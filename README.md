Network architecture is the logical and structural layout of a network. In addition to hardware and physical connections, software, wireless networks and protocols, the medium of data transmission also constitutes the network architecture. Network architecture provides a detailed overview of the whole network, which is used to classify network layers. Organizations use network diagrams to create local area networks, wide-area networks and specific tunnels of communications.

Network Architecture Definition
What Is Neural Network Architecture?
An image featuring neural network architecture concept
Neural network architecture is a type of network design that refers to a network made from individual units, known as neurons. Mimicking the neurons found in a human brain, the neurons can receive input, understand the importance of that input, and then combine multiple inputs into one output value. Activation functions make the output a non-linear combination of all input values.

Note: A neural network has several rows of neurons, and several neurons in a single row constitute a layer, creating a multi-layer neural network. The first layer is called the input layer, followed by hidden layers and, finally, the last layer is the output layer. Hidden layers are intermediate layers that perform the computations, search for and extract features from the data, and pass on the information to the final output layer.
What Is a Network Architecture Diagram?
A Network Architecture Diagram is the visual representation of the network. The layout of the elements that constitute a network is represented with various symbols and lines. Visual representation is the most intuitive way to process information and understand how network elements are connected. This is helpful when organizations are creating new systems or trying to understand where the problem in the network is. The network diagram is created using various software programs, such as SmartDraw, Creately, Intermapper or SolarWinds NTM.

What Is Zero Trust Network Architecture?
Zero Trust Network Architecture is a model of network where every connection to the system has to be verified. The architecture is implemented when the security of the network is ineffective. With numerous users accessing the data from various locations and devices, security breaches are frequent. Zero Trust Network Architecture aims to reduce unauthorized access to the data within the network. Multiple technologies are used to achieve the necessary security, including multi-factor authentication, encryption, IAM (identity and access management), and file system permissions.
General Structure of Neural Network
A neural network has input layer(s), hidden layer(s), and output layer(s). It can make sense of patterns, noise, and sources of confusion in the data. When the features are linearly correlated usually the neural network is not preferred, it can be done by using machine learning. Even in linear correlation if neural networks are used, there is no need for any hidden layer.


Neural networks calculate the weighted sums. The calculated sum of weights is passed as input to the activation function in the hidden layers. The activation function is a function to map the inputs to the desired output. It takes the “weighted sum of input” as the input to the function, adds a bias, and decides whether the neuron should be fired or not. The output layer gives the predicted output, and the model output is compared with the actual output. After training the neural network, the model uses the backpropagation method to improve the performance of the network. The cost function helps to reduce the error rate.

Number of Neurons In Input and Output Layers
The number of neurons in the input layer is equal to the number of features in the data and in very rare cases, there will be one input layer for bias. Whereas the number of neurons in the output depends on whether is the model is used as a regressor or classifier. If the model is a regressor then the output layer will have only a single neuron but in case if the model is a classifier it will have a single neuron or multiple neurons depending on the class label of the model.

Number of Neurons and Number of Layers in Hidden Layer
When it comes to the hidden layers, the main concerns are how many hidden layers and how many neurons are required?

An Introduction to Neural Networks for Java, Second Edition by jeffheaton it is mentioned that number of hidden layers is determined as below.


There are many rule-of-thumb methods for determining the correct number of neurons to use in the hidden layers, such as the following:

The number of hidden neurons should be between the size of the input layer and the size of the output layer.
The number of hidden neurons should be 2/3 the size of the input layer, plus the size of the output layer.
The number of hidden neurons should be less than twice the size of the input layer.
Moreover, the number of neurons and number layers required for the hidden layer also depends upon training cases, amount of outliers, the complexity of, data that is to be learned, and the type of activation functions used.

Most of the problems can be solved by using a single hidden layer with the number of neurons equal to the mean of the input and output layer. If less number of neurons is chosen it will lead to underfitting and high statistical bias. Whereas if we choose too many neurons it may lead to overfitting, high variance, and increases the time it takes to train the network.

Pruning
Pruning can be used to optimize the number of neurons in the hidden and increases computational and resolution performances. It trims the neurons during training, by identifying those which have no impact on the performance of the network. It can also be identified by checking the weights of the neurons, weights that are close to zero have relatively less importance. In pruning such nodes are removed.

What is the Activation Energy?

Well, the activation energy is the extra energy given to get useful work done.

In chemistry, we call it the minimum amount of energy (or threshold energy) needed to activate or energize molecules or atoms to undergo a chemical reaction or transformation. 

The activation energy units are LCal/mo, KJ/mol, and J/mol. 


Concept of Activation Energy

We are familiar with chemical reactions such as the burning of gas in air or the combustion of hydrogen or oxygen gases. This does not occur unless we give some energy in some form to the reacting system. Thus, extra energy should be given to the reactants to bring their energy equal to the threshold energy.

Let’s consider the two products A and B undergo a reaction to form the product C.

A + B → C

We know that the reactant already has some energy, i.e., Er. Now, some amount of energy is given to the reactant. As they gain energy, the molecules of A and B collide and after that, they stick together to form AB at the transition state. This transition state is the energy barrier.

Now, to cross this barrier, extra energy is given and this energy is the activation energy.

So, the excess energy (the energy above the average energy of the reactants) is supplied to reactants to undergo chemical reactions is called activation energy.

Let’s say the reactants (A + B) have 20 KJ of energy, and for crossing the transition state, it needs 60 KJ of energy,  and this energy is the threshold energy (ET). This means 40 KJ of extra energy is added to cross the barrier. So, this extra energy is the activation energy or Ea. After that, they transform into product C.

Here, the energy of product (Ep) > Energy of reactant (Er). However, the reverse is also true.

This means the reactants have to absorb the energy to transform into a product. Therefore, this process is endothermic.

If the  Ep < Er,  the process is exothermic because more energy is released.

Hence, for any transformation to occur, two things are necessary:

Effective collision, and

Enough energy to cross the energy barrier.


Activation Energy Formula

The activation energy is equal to the difference between the threshold energy needed for the reaction and the average kinetic energy of all the reacting molecules. i.e.,

                        



Each reaction has a certain value of Ea and this determines the fraction of total collisions that are effective.

This means if the activation energy for a reaction is low, numerous molecules have this energy, and the fractions of effective collisions are large. The reaction proceeds at a pace. If the activation energy is high, a fraction of effective collisions is small, and the reaction takes place slowly.
The benefit of optimization with machine learning has played an important role in the development of computing science.

If we look at the current scenario, we can say that optimization techniques are used in various small to middle-sized organizations, global industries, and other enterprise solutions for the past long year.
All the engineering goods that are manufactured both physically and virtually are made compact due to optimization solutions of various algorithms. We get benefitted from that.
Machine learning is not a standalone technology, it not only consumes the optimization technology but also it produces new optimization ideas that created a lot of benefits for the end-users.
Because of the huge application base and also productive theoretical approaches, optimization has gained huge importance in conjunction with machine learning.
Since the overall size, capacity, and pricing of the model is on an increase, the optimization techniques have provided unique and better quality optimized approaches to solve the problems.
The heart of machine learning is optimization because the algorithms are involved to find the suitable parameters of the target models by employing the experiences.
There has been a lot of optimization problems that include data fitting and different approaches have been invented for finding the optimized solutions for that.
Algorithms are used for various functions of heuristics search strategies to eradicate optimization problems.
The optimization algorithms produce a set of organized inputs that produce data-driven predictions as an output rather than following a strict set of static algorithm instructions.
Advanced techniques of machine learning help in guiding businesses to an optimal solution at a rapid pace confronting all the optimization problems and solving the same.
With the optimization functionality of machine learning the overall estimation of computational load for a huge data set is solved and optimized.

The optimization algorithm also produces the simplest approach to implement algorithm principles to optimize solutions and problems that were very difficult while using the traditional way of algorithm approach that consumes time and was also inefficient in solving problems.
The optimization algorithm with machine learning has exposed to a greater extent in looking through the problem structure that prevents the overall efficiency of productive outputs. The algorithm techniques are so advanced and future proof that it goes deep down the problems and return the solution from there.
The algorithms also help in fast convergence i.e. in producing effective time for approximate solution of the model. The algorithm is faster and feature-rich to extract the optimized time and solution to provide the best result.
The approach with an algorithm is also very robust and the stability of the approach of numerical solutions of various models is also optimized to produce the best quality result in overall performance.
The convergence and complexity of each algorithm can be better comprehensible and solved using an approach.
The optimization also helps in avoiding local minima and searching for a better approach and solution for providing optimized results and also helps in removing complexity and difficult approach of multidimensional space.
